#. Translators: The name is a play on the French phrase "déjà vu" meaning
#. "already seen", but with the "vu" replaced with "dup".  "Dup" in this
#. context is itself a reference to both the underlying command line tool
#. "duplicity" and the act of duplicating data for backup.  As a whole, it
#. may not be very translatable.
