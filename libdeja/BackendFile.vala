      // our GVFS mounts which are only available on our session dbus.  Which
      // root can't talk to.  Possible workarounds:
      //  * Some magic to let root talk to our gvfs daemons (haven't found yet)
      //  * Use FUSE local paths (root also isn't given access to these mounts)
      //  * Have duplicity notice that it needs root to write to a file, and
      //    then restart itself under sudo.  But then we'd just hit the same
      //    problem again but now duplicity has to solve it...
      //  * Restore to a temporary folder and move files over with sudo.  This
      //    is what we used to always do in older deja-dup.  But it had
      //    several problems with consuming the hard drive, especially if the
      //    user had partitioned in ways we didn't expect.  Hard to know where
      //    a safe spot is to hoard all the files.
      //  * Pass mount username/password to duplicity as environment variables
      //    and have root do the mount itself.  This could work...  if we had
      //    a reliable way to get the username/password.  We could get it from
      //    keyring (even then, only a guess, since the daemon could have set
      //    the 'object' or 'authtype' fields, which we don't know if it did)
      //    or from a MountOperation.  But a user could have mounted it earlier
      //    in session without saving password in keyring.  And we can't force
      //    an unmount on the user just so we can remount it.
      //  * Have duplicity try to mount and ask user for password.  We'd need
      //    to add functionality to duplicity to allow a conversation between a
      //    driving app like deja-dup and itself, to be able to proxy these
      //    prompts and questions to the user.  This would work nicely, but is
      //    a very different interaction model than duplicity uses today.
      //    Much more deja-dup-focused.  If we're going down this direction,
      //    there are all sorts of two-way interactions that we could stand to
      //    benefit from.  Would require a deep rethink of our driving model.
      //
      // So in the absence of an actually good solution, we'll just disable
      // running under sudo if the location is remote.  :(  Maybe our
      // over-eager needs-root algorithm got it wrong anyway. Regardless, this
      // way the user will get a permissions denied error that will point them
      // in the direction of trying to restore in a new folder rather than on
      // top of their running system, which, let's be honest, is probably not
      // a good idea anyway.
