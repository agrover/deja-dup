What's going on here?
   This directory is all about testing Déjà Dup.  The scripts here let you run
   it in a safe testing environment, with any version of duplicity, with any
   size and format mount directory.

How does it work?
   These scripts set up your environment in such a way that your normal Déjà
   Dup settings are not altered.  They also download and install into a
   temporary directory the version of duplicity specified by a test.  All of
   this is done automatically as part of running the test, and it shouldn't
   affect your system's or user's settings or data.
   
   Lastly, it uses the Linux Desktop Testing Project (LDTP) python libraries
   to control the Déjà Dup UI.  Do not have any other Déjà Dup instances running
   while a test is active.

What is required?
   These tests need LDTP >= 2.  They also need you to have first compiled
   the rest of Déjà Dup.  To do this, you just need to build the executables,
   but you don't need to install them.  The tests will find them where they
   sit.

How do I run them?
   There are a couple ways.  You can run the whole suite by running 'make test'
   or an individual test by running it from the 'tests' directory.  For
   example, to run the test 'badversion' in the 'basic' directory, type
   './basic/badversion'.  It will run and return either 0 for success or 1
   for failure.  The 'make test' output is prettier though.
   
   There is also a special test called 'interactive' that just sets up a safe
   testing environment and lets you play with it.  Very useful for testing
   changes to code or just feeling your way around a freshly built executable.

How do I clean up after the tests?
   The only files created as a side-effect are either in /tmp (and should
   mostly clean up after themselves) or in 'duplicity' and 'duplicity-src'
   subdirectories.  These are created to store the downloaded duplicity
   tarballs and installed duplicity executables.  You can safely delete either
   directory.
