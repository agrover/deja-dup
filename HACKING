When making a non-trivial change, remember to add yourself to AUTHORS and help/C/credits.page.

When testing a change, it is helpful to: "./tests/interactive".

Directories:
 • common: shared code that does not require gtk
 • widgets: shared code that does require gtk
 • monitor: daemon that runs in user's session, kicks off deja-dup as needed
 • preferences: control center panel
 • nautilus: nautilus extension
 • deja-dup: deja-dup helper app
 • tools: backup tool backend, handles talking to duplicity
 • data: schemas, icons, desktop files, etc
 • help: help documentation
 • vapi: some helper APIs for vala
 • tests: test scripts

TODO:
 • use GResource

Backend split:
What do we need?
* describe-credentials (like:
  * username
  * password
  * folder)
* here-are-credentials (secret how?)
* put-these
* get-these
* list
* size-of-these (to make sure there is room)
basically, same as duplicity, duh!
