= New to deja-dup? =

When making a non-trivial change, remember to add yourself to AUTHORS and deja-dup/help/C/credits.page

deja-dup uses meson, but for most development purposes, you can simply use the convenience top-level Makefile:
 * To build: make
 * To test: make check
 * To install: make install DESTDIR=/tmp/deja-dup

When testing a change, it is helpful to run ./tests/shell (or shell-local if you want a silo'd dbus environment too)
That will give you a full shell pointing at all your built executables.

== Folder Layout ==
 * libdeja: non-GUI library that wraps policy and hides complexity of duplicity
 * deja-dup: GNOME UI for libdeja, including integration points with nautilus and control-center
 * data: shared schemas, icons, etc
 * vapi: some helper APIs for vala

== Flatpak ==

To build a local flatpak, run 'make flatpak'. You'll want an up-to-date flatpak-builder though.

If you're on Ubuntu:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:alexlarsson/flatpak
sudo apt update
