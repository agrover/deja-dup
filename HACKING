When making a non-trivial change, remember to add yourself to AUTHORS and help/C/credits.page.

When testing a change, it is helpful to: "./libdeja/tests/interactive".

Directories:
 • libdeja: non-GUI library that wraps policy and hides complexity of duplicity
 • deja-dup: GNOME UI for libdeja, including integration points with nautilus and control-center
 • data: schemas, icons, desktop files, etc
 • vapi: some helper APIs for vala

TODO:
 • use GResource

Backend split:
What do we need?
* describe-credentials (like:
  * username
  * password
  * folder)
* here-are-credentials (secret how?)
* put-these
* get-these
* list
* size-of-these (to make sure there is room)
basically, same as duplicity, duh!
