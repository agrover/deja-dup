Déjà Dup 10.0
-------------
* Use GIO, letting one backup to FTP, WebDAV, and Windows Networking servers.
* Add a 'Details' box when backing up or restoring.  This lets you see the
  full path of each file as it is touched (rather than just the filename).
* If the user tries to backup or restore for the first time, show the relevant
  preferences in the wizard directly.  Don't require that they first open the
  Preferences window.
* Add a more complete summary right before user approves a backup or restore.
* Bug fixes and UI tweaks

Déjà Dup 9.3 (2009-05-30)
-------------------------
* Exclude ~/.Private, not ~/Private.  This means we no longer backup the
  encrypted version of ecryptfs files, but the unencrypted version.  So
  encrypt your backups appropriately.  This change lets us work more elegantly
  in all ecryptfs setups, especially when your whole home directory is
  encrypted.
* Update icons to Tango style ones
* Relicense help documentation from GFDL to GPL-3+
* Some minor bug fixes

Déjà Dup 9.2 (2009-05-09)
-------------------------
* Re-enable some kinder, specific messages for certain duplicity exceptions,
  including I/O errors and 'destination out of space' errors
* Enable translation of user documentation (man pages and manual)
* Updated English (UK), French, German, and Russian translations

Déjà Dup 9.1 (2009-04-27)
-------------------------
* Strip spaces from the ends of passwords, they are likely just cut+paste
  errors from web sites -- notably Amazon's S3 password page (LP: #362899).
* Make bleeding-edge GTK+ symbols introduced by vala 0.7 optional, so we now
  compile again with GTK+ 2.12.

Déjà Dup 9.0 (2009-04-26)
-------------------------
* Use 'nice' for duplicity subprocess to be less of a resource hog
* Make folder include/exclude lists scrollable if too large
* Add some additional default excludes and document all such defaults in the
  user help:
  ~/.xsession-errors
  ~/.recently-used.xbel
  ~/.recent-applications.xbel
  ~/Private (LP: #320019)
* Support recent duplicity feature that allows migrating vfat users to new
  filename scheme
* Show exception text if duplicity fails
* Fix crash if gconf schema isn't installed (LP: #318146)

* New Finnish, Pashto, and Russian translations

Déjà Dup 8.1 (2009-04-03)
-------------------------

  versions less than 2.6.25.  LP: #352492

* Updated Dutch, French, German, and Swedish translations

Déjà Dup 7.4 (2009-02-11)
-------------------------
* Don't ask for S3 bucket name (and default to deja-dup).  Buckets are
  S3-global and that default is certainly taken.  Instead, generate bucket name
  from user ID.  Ask user for an optional folder in the bucket instead.
* Fix bug that prevented cleanup on FAT32.
* If no passphrase is provided, turn off encryption.
* Add better errors for a couple cases (bad encryption password, not signed up
  for S3).
* New Dutch translation
* Updated French, Hebrew, and Spanish translations

* New Swedish translation

Déjà Dup 4.0
