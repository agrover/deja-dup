When making a non-trivial change, remember to add yourself to AUTHORS and help/C/credits.page.

When testing a change, it is helpful to: "cd tests; ./interactive".  It has many interesting options, check the script and base.py to know more.

Directories:
 • common: shared code that does not require gtk
 • widgets: shared code that does require gtk
 • monitor: daemon that runs in user's session, kicks off deja-dup as needed
 • preferences: control center panel
 • nautilus: nautilus extension
 • deja-dup: deja-dup helper app
 • data: schemas, icons, desktop files, etc
 • help: help documentation
 • vapi: some helper APIs for vala
 • tests: test scripts

To do next cycle:
 • bump supported valac
   • drop old valac #ifdef blocks
   • fix deprecation warnings
 • bump required gtk if we have #ifdefs
   • drop old gtk #ifdef blocks
   • review new gtk symbols
 • use GResource

Backend split:
What do we need?
* describe-credentials (like:
  * username
  * password
  * folder)
* here-are-credentials (secret how?)
* put-these
* get-these
* list
* size-of-these (to make sure there is room)
basically, same as duplicity, duh!
