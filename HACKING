= New to deja-dup? =

When making a non-trivial change, remember to add yourself to AUTHORS and deja-dup/help/C/credits.page

deja-dup uses cmake, but for most development purposes, you can simply use the convenience top-level Makefile:
 * To build: make
 * To test: make check
 * To install: make install DESTDIR=/tmp/deja-dup

When testing a change, it is helpful to run ./tests/shell
That will give you a full shell pointing at all your built executables.

== Folder Layout ==
 * libdeja: non-GUI library that wraps policy and hides complexity of duplicity
 * deja-dup: GNOME UI for libdeja, including integration points with nautilus and control-center
 * data: shared schemas, icons, etc
 * vapi: some helper APIs for vala

= Development Notes =

== How to Release ==

 * Update help documentation (new arguments, new gui labels)
 * make check dist
 * debuild, install (to catch any foolish errors that check missed)
 * Update CMakeLists.txt version
 * Tag bzr with new release number (4.0 for 4.0)
 * Update LP (new release, new download)
 * NEWSTABLE: Update LP testing recipe version
 * STABLE: New screenshots if needed for wiki [1]
 * Announce on LP
 * Mark bugs fix released on LP

[1] Screenshots:
 * Alt+PrntScreen to get just the current window

== TODO ==
 * use GResource

== Backend Split Notes ==

What do we need?
 * describe-credentials like:
   * username
   * password
   * folder
 * here-are-credentials (secret how?)
 * put-these
 * get-these
 * list
 * size-of-these (to make sure there is room)

basically, same as duplicity, duh!
